# Data Science Portfolio: Translating Analytics into Real-World Impact

## Professional Motivation
My goal is to advance into **applied data science for healthcare & agritech**—fields where data-driven decisions directly improve outcomes (e.g., patient care efficiency, food security). My projects are rooted in solving tangible industry challenges: NIPT testing optimization addresses gaps in prenatal care accessibility, while wheat yield prediction supports small-scale farmers with actionable forecasts.


## Education
**B.S. in Data Science**
- Core Competencies: Statistical modeling (Bayesian inference, mixed-effects models), machine learning (ensemble methods, time-series forecasting), programming (Python/R for data pipeline development, Tkinter for GUI tooling).


## Projects
### 1. NIPT Optimal Timing & Abnormality Detection (Collaborative Project)
*Partnered with 2 clinical researchers to align model outputs with clinical workflows*
- **Statistical Reasoning**: Built a Beta-GAMM model to quantify how maternal BMI/gestational age interact to impact fetal DNA concentration—validated via 2,000+ patient records to ensure clinical relevance.
- **Optimization**: Designed a time-weighted Risk-Minimization model to recommend testing windows, reducing unnecessary retests by 22% (per clinician feedback on practical implementation).
- **Machine Learning**: Implemented EasyEnsemble + Conformal Prediction for abnormality detection; 95% recall rate (critical for minimizing false negatives) was verified via peer review with diagnostic lab teams.
- **Communication**: Presented technical results (model thresholds, uncertainty bounds) in visual dashboards for non-technical clinicians, and summarized key findings in a 1-page clinical guideline brief.


### 2. Wheat Yield Prediction via Machine Learning (Individual Project)
*Independent development with stakeholder input from agronomists*
- **Data Reasoning**: Integrated 5+ multi-source datasets (weather time-series, soil NPK levels, NDVI satellite imagery) — cleaned and normalized data to account for regional variability (e.g., rainfall measurement inconsistencies).
- **Predictive Modeling**: Compared ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and LSTM; XGBoost outperformed LSTM in short-term forecasts (R²=0.88 post-Bayesian hyperparameter tuning).
- **Technical Competence**: Used Python (Pandas/Scikit-learn) for pipeline automation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn to create interactive yield trend charts (shared with agronomists for field validation).
- **Impact Focus**: Translated model outputs into a farmer-facing tool (simplified web interface prototype) that predicts yield deviations 4 weeks in advance.


## Collaboration & Technical Skills
- **Collaboration**: Led weekly syncs for the NIPT project to split tasks (data cleaning, model validation, stakeholder outreach) and resolve misalignments (e.g., adjusting model assumptions to match clinical sampling protocols).
- **Technical Proficiency**: Mastered Python (Pandas for multi-source data integration, XGBoost for predictive modeling, Tkinter for GUI tooling) and R (lme4 for mixed-effects models); experienced in Excel automation for QAQC workflows.
- **Communication**: Adapted work to 2 audience levels: technical stakeholders (detailed model performance reports) and non-technical end-users (visual dashboards, 1-page summaries).
