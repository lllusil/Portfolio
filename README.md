### Projects
· NIPT Optimal Timing & Abnormality Detection 
- Statistical Modeling: Developed a Beta-GAMM model to quantify how maternal BMI and gestational age affect fetal DNA concentration
- Optimization: Built a Risk-Minimization model using time-weighted penalties to recommend optimal testing windows
- Machine Learning: Implemented EasyEnsemble with Conformal Prediction to detect fetal abnormalities, achieving a 95% recall rate
· Wheat Yield Prediction via Machine Learning
- Data Integration: Processed multi-source datasets including historical weather, soil properties, and satellite imagery (NDVI)
- Predictive Modeling: Developed and compared ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost) and LSTM for time-series forecasting.
- Optimization: Improved prediction accuracy (R²) to 0.88 through Bayesian hyperparameter tuning and feature selection
